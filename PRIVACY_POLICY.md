# Privacy Policy for EliteApp

**Last updated:** February 12, 2025

EliteApp ("the Extension") is a browser extension that applies a YouTube Premium–style look to supported sites (e.g., icons and themes). This policy describes what data the Extension uses and how it is handled.

---

## 1. Data We Use

The Extension uses minimal data, only to provide its features:

| Data | Where it is stored | Purpose |
|------|--------------------|--------|
| **Enable/disable setting** | Chrome sync storage (your Google account) | Saves your "Enable extension" preference so it can sync across your devices and persist after you close the browser. |
| **Install timestamp** | Chrome local storage (on your device only) | Stored once when you install the Extension (e.g., for internal reference). Not tied to your identity. |

We do **not** collect your name, email, browsing history, or any other personally identifiable information.

---

## 2. Where Your Data Stays

- **Chrome sync storage** and **Chrome local storage** are provided by Google Chrome and stay under your control. The Extension does not send this data to our own servers or to any third party.
- We do **not** operate servers that receive, store, or process your personal data.
- The Extension does **not** load or execute code from the internet; all logic runs from the Extension’s bundled files.

---

## 3. Permissions and Why We Use Them

- **Storage** — To save and read your "Enable extension" setting and the install timestamp, as described above.
- **Active tab** — To know which tab is active when you use the Extension (e.g., to swap the logo on that page). Access is temporary and only when you interact with the Extension.
- **Host access (e.g. "all URLs")** — So the Extension can run on the sites you visit and apply the Premium-style theme and icons. We do not collect or send page content anywhere.

---

## 4. Third Parties

- The Extension may load a **static image** (e.g., a logo) from Google’s servers (e.g. gstatic.com) only as a fallback when our own assets are not used. This is an image request only; no personal data is sent.
- Your use of Chrome and its sync/local storage is subject to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Selling

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for advertising or marketing. We do not have servers that receive your personal data.

---

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the Extension after changes means you accept the updated policy.

## 7. Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or the Extension’s data practices, please contact us at the address or method you use to reach the publisher of EliteApp (e.g., the contact details listed in the Chrome Web Store listing).
